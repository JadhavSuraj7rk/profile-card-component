## My process

I built this web page using mobile first workflow , only to perceive the card itself doesn't change at all for the desktop version and for the layout I used flexbox. 

### Feedback


I am not sure of the best way of approaching the background images in this case. I attempted to use VW units to make it responsive, but this seems to be not correct as the screen size changes it will not react as I expected. Any suggestion would be appreciated here.
